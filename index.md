# Introduction
OpenDoc is a simple and easy way to make documents easily searchable and available to the public. You can modify, track changes and submit edit requests easily on the platform. This can be done through the web interface or locally on your computer.

## Why use OpenDoc?

**Mobile responsive**

All documents that are shared on the site will be mobile responsive by default! We take care of the design so that you can focus on the content!

**Elastic Search**

You're no longer bounded by exact keyword search. Make use of elasticsearch to search through your documents quickly and accurately.

**Speedy surfing**

Opendoc is essentially a static site with no backend integration at all. You no longer have to wait minutes for a site to get loaded, and all sites get loaded in milliseconds!
