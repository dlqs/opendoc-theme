# Part V: Hearings via Skype

## 34. Video-Conferencing using Skype

### Introduction

(1) The State Courts will allow solicitors to use Skype, a free and accessible service, to mention cases on the following hearing lists that satisfy the criteria set out opposite thereto:

| **Registry / Department** | **Hearing Lists** | **Criteria** |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Civil Registry**        | Ex-parte summons list (Wednesday mornings)<br/>Garnishee list (Tuesday and Thursday afternoons)<br/>Summons for Directions (Tuesdays and Thursdays)<br/>Duty Registrar matters (every day)<br/>Taxation list (Friday mornings) | Uncontested matters for selected hearing lists where no documents will be tendered and the party attending via Skype is mentioning for all other parties (if applicable). |
| **State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution** | Court Dispute Resolution sessions for non-injury motor accident claims and personal injury claims arising from motor vehicle accidents (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) | Court Dispute Resolution sessions for non-injury motor accident claims and personal injury claims arising from motor vehicle accidents where no documents will be tendered. |

(2) This will enable solicitors to mention their cases via Skype instead of personally attending Court for many short mentions which generally will not last beyond 10 minutes.

### Guidelines and Procedures

(3) Unless approval has been previously given, solicitors seeking to mention their cases via Skype at the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution after 1 May 2015 must file a Request for Hearing Administrative Support via the Electronic Filing Service not less than 2 working days before the date of the hearing. All requests are subject to the approval of the Judge or Registrar.

(4) Solicitors mentioning their cases via Skype must comply with the guidelines and procedures set out in the Schedule below.

### Court etiquette

(5) A solicitor mentioning a case via Skype must proceed with the hearing as if he or she were appearing before the Judge in person, and must comply with all Court rules of etiquette as prescribed in these Practice Directions and any relevant Registrar’s Circular.

### Adjournment of Skype hearing

(6) If for any reason the presiding Judge or Registrar considers that it is not expedient for any hearing to continue via Skype, he or she may —

> (a) adjourn the matter and require parties to attend Court personally on an appointed date and time;

> (b) conduct the hearing via telephone; or

> (c) make any other direction that may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

### Hearing Records

(7) Hearings conducted via Skype shall not be recorded on video or audio tape or any other form.
